When adding a WooCommerce category in your header menu, this plugin allows you to show a dropdown of the products you have listed inside.

== Description ==

Let us say you want your WooCommerce customer to be able to reach the product they are looking for with the least amount of clicks possible. This is exactly what this plugin is made for. When adding a WooCommerce category as a first level in your header menu, this WordPress plugin allows you to show a dropdown of a defined number of products upon hover over the menu point. If the category includes less than the predefinied number of products, each product is displayed with image, title and price. Above this value, products are only listed with name and price in order to save space. This way potential customers get a quick and easy overview without a single click and can directly reach the product they may be looking for. 

Be aware that this visualization is only visible on Desktop!
